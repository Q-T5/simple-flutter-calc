## ABOUT
This is my first ever Flutter project deployed on Android. It works well on Android 9+ and is a simple calculator app written with Flutter's material UI widget and the `setState()` function.
Feel free to download the app in the releases section and try it out.
Below is a simple demo of the app :)
